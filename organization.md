# Project Organization

Since there are a lot of documents to transfer from the master file to the template it is important that they are managed well.  Otherwise a lot of time can be taken figuring out where files are to be placed in the journal.

Things to consider when organizing this work is a naming convention and folder structure.  Additionally, I would include two files with your project a todo or tasks file that can be used to keep track of things that need to be done.  This can be shared with everyone or not but it might be helpful.  I would also include the index or journals table of contents handy somewhere for reference.

## Folder Structure
There are two obvious ways to organize this project with nested or flat folder structure. 

### Nested Structure
You can create nested folders. That is to say, for each section of the journal related files are placed in that sections folder. 

For instance the nested folder structure would look something like this:

```
/delfines-2018 (top/project folder)
    |----todo.txt (things-todo)
    |----index.docx (the index or journals table of contents for reference)
    |----/poesia (poesia section)
    |       |---artilce1.docx
    |       |---article2.docx
    |----/prosa
    |       |---artilce1.docx
    |       |---article2.docx
    |----/drama
            |---artilce1.docx
            |---article2.docx
```

### Flat Structure
A flat structure is one that keeps all files in one folder.  Although this sounds difficult it might prove manageable (and possibly easier) if the right naming convention was adopted. The progress of the journal and all files would be visible by just viewing the folder.

For example it might look something like this:
```
/delfines-2018 (top/project folder)
    |----todo.txt (things-todo)
    |----index.docx (the index or journals table of contents for reference)
    |----01-p-gomez.docx
    |----02-p-cuevas-1.docx
    |----02-p-cuevas-2.docx
    |----03-pr-cuevas.docx
    |----03-pr-munoz.docx
    |----04-d-sanchez.docx
```

## Naming Convention
Depending on whether you choose to organize files in a nested or flat structure an appropriate naming convention will help.  

**NOTE:**

_If you are naming files that begin with a page number keep in mind that single digit page numbers should have a leading zero. Most files when viewed in the file explorer line up based on the leading number.  For instance the numbers 1, 2, 3, 10, 22 would line up as (1,10,2,22,3) To prevent this add a leading zero to the single digit pages (01, 02, 03, 10,22)_

### Simple Naming
For a nested structure you can use simple naming. This would be a convention that includes the page number, author name, and order if there is more than article or author on the same page.

* eg. For Gomez's article on page 47 would be named `47_gomez.docx`
* Alternatively if there is more than one Gomez on the same page the file would be (`47a_gomez.docx` and `47b_gomez.docx`) or  (`47_gomez1.docx` and `47_gomez2.docx`)

### Complex naming
Complex naming can be used in either type of folder structure but can makes sense for a flat folder structure.  A complex scheme would include page number, section, author, and other relevant details.  The thing to consider when developing a scheme is how do you want the files to be lined up when viewing them in a folder.  That is should they be organized by page number first or section.

* eg. Taking the above example we could add a section to the files so it would be ```47-p-gomez.docx```
* The same would be done for authors with the same last name on the same page.
